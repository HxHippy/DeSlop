## Detection System

De-Slop uses a **three-tier aggression system**:

### Tier 1: AI-Specific Indicators (3 points each)
Signature AI phrases and patterns:
- "delve into", "navigate the landscape", "tapestry of", "realm of possibilities"
- Em dash overuse, excessive transitions
- "In today's fast-paced world...", "As we continue to evolve..."
- Stop words: "I'm excited to announce", "Thrilled to share"
- Listicle patterns: "Top 10 ways to...", "Ultimate guide to..."

**Active at all sensitivity levels**

### Tier 2: Corporate Buzzwords (2 points each)
LinkedIn's greatest hits:
- "synergy", "leverage", "circle back", "low-hanging fruit"
- "take this offline", "touch base", "thought leadership"
- "AI-powered", "blockchain-enabled", "digital transformation"

**Active at sensitivity 3+**

### Tier 3: Marketing Spam (1 point each)
The widest net:
- "free", "guaranteed", "limited time offer", "buy now"
- "amazing", "incredible", "revolutionary", "mind-blowing"
- "basically", "essentially", "actually"

**Active at sensitivity 4+**

### Scoring Thresholds

| Sensitivity | Threshold | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | 15 points | Very conservative - obvious AI only |
| 2 | 12 points | Conservative |
| 3 | 9 points | **Balanced (default)** - AI + corporate |
| 4 | 6 points | Aggressive - includes marketing |
| 5 | 4 points | Nuclear - maximum detection |

### LinkedIn Fixer
When on LinkedIn, additional toggles appear:
- Block auto-play videos
- Block ad tracking
- Enable darker mode (true black theme)

## How It Works

1. Scans page content using platform-specific selectors
2. Assigns weighted "slop score" based on pattern matches
3. Removes elements exceeding threshold
4. Updates badge counter
5. Monitors for dynamic content (infinite scroll, AJAX)

### Platform Support
- **LinkedIn**: `.feed-shared-update-v2` (individual posts)
- **Twitter/X**: `[data-testid="tweet"]`
- **Medium**: `article`, `.postArticle`
- **All sites**: Generic article/post/card selectors

## Privacy

De-Slop:
- ✓ Runs entirely locally - no data sent to servers
- ✓ Stores settings in Chrome sync storage
- ✓ No analytics or tracking
- ✓ No external API calls
- ✓ Open source - inspect the code

## Permissions

- `storage` - Save your settings
- `activeTab` - Access current page content
- `declarativeNetRequest` - Block LinkedIn ads (optional)
- `<all_urls>` - Scan any page for slop

## Known Limitations

- Pattern-based detection may have false positives
- Very short content (<100 chars) skipped to reduce false positives
- Platform selectors may need updates when sites change
- If your entire LinkedIn feed disappears - it's all slop! Lower sensitivity.
